## Project Description

A weather dashboard that makes checking the forecast a delightful experience. Built with Vue.js and the OpenWeather API, it provides comprehensive weather data in a clean, intuitive interface.

## Features

- **Current Conditions**: Temperature, feels like, humidity, wind speed, and UV index
- **Hourly Forecast**: 48-hour forecast with temperature and precipitation probability
- **Weekly Forecast**: 7-day outlook with high/low temperatures
- **Interactive Maps**: Visualize weather patterns with Mapbox integration
- **Location Management**: Save multiple locations and switch between them instantly

## Technical Details

This was one of my earlier projects exploring Vue.js. It demonstrates API integration, state management with Vuex, and creating reusable components.

The challenge was handling multiple API calls efficiently and presenting data clearly without overwhelming the user.
