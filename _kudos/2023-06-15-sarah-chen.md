Milos consistently demonstrated exceptional technical leadership during our cloud infrastructure migration project. His deep understanding of AWS services and DevOps best practices helped us reduce deployment times by 60% and significantly improve system reliability.

What impressed me most was his ability to mentor junior developers while simultaneously architecting complex solutions. He introduced automated testing and CI/CD pipelines that became the foundation of our development workflow.

Milos has a rare combination of technical depth and communication skills that makes him invaluable to any engineering team. I highly recommend him for any senior technical role.
